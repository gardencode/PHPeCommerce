Hey, who ever is looking at this cart here is how to run it!
The database associated to the products is called products.sql run this in workbench first and 
navigate local host where you saved it and run cart.php will need to type this in the url.

This has basic products and i think can be changed for our db easily, all this does is add to cart 
and delete the product so if anyone can help that would be great.

Issues: element 0 in array of products in cart doesnt delete and i cant figure it out.
